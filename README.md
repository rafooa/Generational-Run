##Game title
Generational Run


#Concept statement
It is an endless side-scroller that merges eras together seamlessly, requiring the player to utilize multi-generational tools to overcome obstacles.

#Genre(s)
Side-scrolling Platformer

#Visual and Audio Style
Fast paced gameplay, forcing the player to make quick decisions and punishing incorrect choices. Pixel artstyle and a blend of both 8-bit and modern sound effects.
 
#Game World Narrative
In the very distant future, our main character accidentally ends up in a wormhole with the fabric of time collapsing around him. He must find a way back to his time, as the fabric of reality crumbles behind him. 


#Core Loops
The core loop is the urgency of the player to make the correct decision to traverse obstacles as they keep appearing in front of them.

#Objectives and Progression
The player moves from left to right away from the crumbling reality and can mainly jump and crouch, in addition to the other tools at their disposal. Short term goals include collectables that aid the progress and long-term goals are the high score (farthest distance reached). The sense of urgency is directly linked to the playerâ€™s struggle to escape the wormhole and the setting and surroundings link with the idea of timelines converging.

#Game Systems
Camera scrolls from left to right and the player must keep up with it or they fall into the void. Player interacts with the platforms and obstacles in their path. 


#Interactivity
All actions are performed through different keyboard inputs, most important being jump and crouch buttons. Only vertical movement is in the hands of the player, horizontal movement is done automatically. Combat/Physics involve precise timing by the player.
